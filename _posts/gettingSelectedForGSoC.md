## Getting selected for GSoC'23@RADIS

I am Somesh Verma,a third year undergrad at National Institute of Technology Hamirpur. I have been accepted as contributor to the OpenAstronomy  RADIS.

### Chossing Organisation 
I  chose OpenAstronomy as i have interest in astronomy right from my childhood and RADIS also aline with my interst and skills .I have also contributed to Libre Health App for Baby Care but then i shifted my focus i attention only to RADIS . By the end i had four merged pull request and I was working on the fifth issue.

### Contriutions and Experience 
I started to contribute to RADIS from January'23 , initially i faced problem to set the things and see by running the code . After one or so I fixed the issues and than I spend one week on understanding the codebase ,read documentation and try examples. By now , i had developed a rough understanding of the code .

Then , I started to find issue over which i can work and started to work on the issues ,mentors have been quite helpful so far so whenever i got stuck somewhere ,they in resolving the issue .


I am looking forward to have the great Learning experience this Summer with RADIS :)
